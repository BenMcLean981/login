# Login (C++ Project)

This is a small project I started to familiarize myself with C++ a little bit. The idea is to have a balanced binary tree storing a list of users that we create, read, update, or delete from the console. This tree will be read and written to the disk, and is to function similar to a database.

### Building

To build and run, execute the following.

```
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```

### CMake

I'm very unfamiliar with C++ build systems, and so I followed a pattern set out in this [repo](https://github.com/gokhanettin/cmake-example).
